/*
The code defines a function called "square" which takes a single argument "num".

The function uses the "return" keyword to return the result of the expression "num * num". This expression calculates the square of the number passed as an argument to the function.

The function uses the arrow function syntax, which consists of the "const" keyword, followed by the function name "square", a list of parameters inside parentheses "num", and the function body inside curly braces "{ }". The function body consists of a single line of code which calculates the square of the number and returns the result.

When the function is called, it will take a single argument which will be passed to the "num" parameter. The function will then calculate the square of this number and return the result.

//square functions

const square = (num) => {
   return num * num 	
}


//the function bellow is using the classic javascript function to solve the same problem

function square(num){
  return num * num
}
