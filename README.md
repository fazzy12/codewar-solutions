# Codewar Solutions
Welcome to my repository for solutions to coding challenges on Codewars!

Codewar is a website that offers a range of coding challenges, called "kata," in various programming languages. These challenges range in difficulty from beginner to advanced.

This repository contains my solutions to various kata that I have completed on the Codewars website. I have included a brief explanation of my thought process for each solution, as well as any relevant notes or optimizations.

I hope that this repository can serve as a useful resource for others looking for example solutions to these kata, as well as a portfolio of my coding skills.
